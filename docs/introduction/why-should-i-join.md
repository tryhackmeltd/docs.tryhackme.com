We want to make the entire process of both teaching and learning cyber security a lot easier. As a student, you can join rooms on different areas of security, learn practical skills about these areas, and building an amazing skillset.

We know that it can be a pain to set up teaching material and keep track of users' progress. Creating rooms makes it easier for anyone (both casually and professionally) to teach cyber security classes. With a click of a button, you can make your own material available to students, and easily check up on how well they are doing with the class. TryHackMe is perfect for setting up CTFs, Workshops, Assignments or Assessments with our user tracking functionality.
