## TODO - Getting Started

Rooms are a virtual space where you can easily allocate tasks to users. You can create rooms for challenges (CTF's) or to run a particular workshop or training session.

The process to start allocating tasks to users is below:

1. [Create a room](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/rooms/creating-a-room).
2. [Upload material](https://tryhackme.com/upload) (VMs or other files) or use the ones we provide.
3. [Assign tasks for a room](https://tryhackme.com/assign-tasks).
4. Give your users your room code and have them join.
5. The users in the room will now be informed to complete the given task.
