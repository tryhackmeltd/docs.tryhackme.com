## Installing the OpenVPN Client on Linux
The following documentation assumes that you are using a Linux distribution that uses `apt-get` package manager. For example, Ubuntu, Debian and Kali Linux uses this.

Firstly you will need to open a terminal and update your systems local copy of the apt package lists. It is always good practice to do so before installing any software:

1.  `sudo apt-get update`

It is extremely easy to install:

2.  `sudo apt-get install openvpn`
