Your [level](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/rooms/tryhackme-levels) on TryHackMe can be copied across as a role on the discord service. Right now this process is not automatic, so you will need to repeat the following steps whenever you level up on the website.

1. First, navigate to your profile on TryHackMe and click on the "Other" Tab:

3. Click on the Bot and type `!verify` into the message box that appears. Press Space, then paste your token.

4. Press "Enter" and the bot will update your roles!
