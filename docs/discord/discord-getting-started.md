TryHackMe has a very active community on Discord. You can use this invite link to join the server:

[**https://discord.gg/tryhackme**](https://discord.gg/tryhackme)

Please note that you may need to have a mobile phone connected to your Discord account to join. This is a common requirement for large - especially infosec - communities.  We use this to help prevent spam and verify users. We have no access to your mobile phone number, nor use it in any other way.

Once in the server, you can sync your [level on TryHackMe](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/general/tryhackme-levels) across as a role on Discord by following the instructions in the [verify document](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/discord/verify).
