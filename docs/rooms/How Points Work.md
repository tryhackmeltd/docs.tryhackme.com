Completing rooms gets you a certain number of points. A breakdown of how questions are scored as follows:

![How Points Work Table](https://i.imgur.com/f5ba1Er.png)

If the room type is a walkthrough room, you only get 25% of those points added to your account score. Challenge rooms receive 100% if the room has been released during this month.

All points you get are added to your ‘All-time’ score, however not all points are added to your ‘Monthly’ score (which is reset to 0 on the last day of the month 23:59 GMT). You only get 100% of a room's monthly points if a room has been released during that month; you get 25% of challenge room points if its not releaed in this month. This stops new users being able obtain large amounts of points as they have more rooms to solve than older users - by monthly points only being awarded if a room is released this month, everyone has a fair chance to be number 1 on the ‘Monthly’ leaderboard and everyone has an equal chance to be number 1 on the ‘All-time’ leaderboard.
Every question answered gets you an additional "wiggle" score, where there is between 0 and 20 random extra points added. The wiggle is not awarded to the three users to answer the question, this helps keep first blood points worth it.

**Summary**
* Challenge rooms released this month, give you 100% of the points (to both your all-time and monthly score).
* Old challenge rooms (not released this month) will give you 25% of the points to your monthly score and 100% to your all-time score.
* Walkthrough rooms released this month, give you 25% of the points to both your all-time and monthly score.
* Old Walkthrough rooms (not released this month) only give you 25% of the points to your all-time score, none for your monthly score.
* Extra wiggle points awarded after third person to answer the question.
