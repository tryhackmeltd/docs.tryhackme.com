Tryhackme works on a level system. This is also echoed over into the Discord server, if you're a member of that.
Levels are obtained by playing rooms on the website. You will get a certain number of [points](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/rooms/how-points-work) for each question that you complete. Challenge rooms give more points than walkthrough rooms, and recent rooms give more points still.
There are currently 13 levels:
```
* 0x1
* 0x2
* 0x3
* 0x4
* 0x5
* 0x6
* 0x7
* 0x8 [Hacker]
* 0x9 [Omni]
* 0xA [Wizard]
* 0xB [Master]
* 0xC [Guru]
* 0xD [God]
```
These are obtained at the following number of points:
```
* 0x1          -- 0
* 0x2          -- 1000
* 0x3          -- 2500
* 0x4          -- 5000
* 0x5          -- 7500
* 0x6          -- 10000
* 0x7          -- 15000
* 0x8 [Hacker] -- 20000
