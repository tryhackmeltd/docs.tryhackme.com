Tryhackme works on a level system. This is also [echoed over into the Discord server](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/discord/verify), if you're a member of that.
Levels are obtained by playing rooms on the website. You will get a certain number of [points](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/rooms/how-points-work) for each question that you complete. Challenge rooms give more points than walkthrough rooms, and recent rooms give more points still.
There are currently 13 levels:
```
* 0x1
* 0x2
* 0x3
* 0x4
* 0x5
* 0x6
* 0x7
* 0x8 [Hacker]
* 0x9 [Omni]
* 0xA [Wizard]
* 0xB [Master]
* 0xC [Guru]
* 0xD [Expert]
```
These are obtained at the following number of points:

| Title / Rank  | Point Requirement  |
|---|---|
| 0x1  | 0 |
| 0x2  | 200 |
